## General info

This project allows you to test a Z80 CPU.

It tries
1. to identify the CPU technology (NMOS/CMOS),
2. to identify the CPU manufacturer,
3. to test whether the CPU is still functional,

and helps

4. to find out the max. supported clock rate.

The above results will help to identify fake CPUs.

It does not test
* Interrupts
* WAIT and HALT signals
* M1 and RFSH signals
* BUSRQ and BUSACK signals

The hardware has following features:
* 32kb EPROM (27C256), alternatively AT29C256 Flash Memory can be used (an AT28C256 is *not* pin compatible)
* 32kb SRAM
* 2 output ports (1x unidirectional, 1x read-back) with 16 LEDs
* RESET and NMI button
* 16 MHz / 20 MHz switchable
* 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 multiplicator (1-16 MHz / 1.25-20 MHz)
* Connectors for measuring CPU power consumption
* USB powered
* THT for easy soldering

## Technologies

The project uses [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) and [zmac](http://48k.ca/zmac.html).

## Examples

Zilog Z84C0020PEC from a Chinese marketplace. It is a U880 (running with 10 MHz):
